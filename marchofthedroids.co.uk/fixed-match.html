                        <p>
                            Let’s get one thing out of the way – fixing matches is highly illegal, and anyone responsible for pre-determining the result of a sporting event, should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Betting on matches that are allegedly fixed, on the other hand, is not illegal! It is every punter’s dream to be able to detect when a match is fixed so that they can make the right wager. While there are no sure ways to find out if a match is fixed (if you’re not the one doing the fixing), the few tips discussed in this article may help you gain a better perspective.

                        <p>Pre-match and in-play odds can serve as a good indicator if a match is being fixed. It is generally accepted that odds will drop slightly if enough players bet on a particular market. However, when the odds of any market change considerably in a very short time, that’s an indication that a large sum of money has been placed on that particular market. Although large bets on high-profile events aren’t that unusual, they do strike a red flag when they are made on small leagues and competitions.  </p>

                    <h2 class="vertical-padding-little">Event Officials and Players Can Be a Part of the Scheme</h2>
                    <p>It is known that judges and referees can also be a part of the greater scheme of things – there are quite a few cases where sports officials that provide judgment in a specific match would take the side of one team. Spotting this “favouritism” may give the punter the ability to predict which team is going to win. On the other hand, spotting a player that tries to “throw” the game can also serve as an indicator that a match can be fixed. The overall issue with any of these events is that they can be observed only during the match itself. <a href="handicap-betting">Can we use both of handicap betting and fixed matches at once?</a></p>

                    <h2 class="vertical-padding-little">Switching Players Before or During an Event </h2>
                    <p>Team-based sports try to start any game with their best people right away. A strong start often is a precursor for victory, but if a team comprised of reserve players enters a competition, there is a chance that something is fishy. In the sporting world, it’s common to see some MVP’s “sitting out a game,” especially if they are recovering from injury; however, we live in a world where if Ronaldo stubbed his toe, everyone would know until the end of the day. If there is no logical reason for a good player to be taken out of play for a particular sporting event, you might be looking at a fixed match.  </p>

                        Looking for Unfair Advantages </h2>
                    <p>Game fixing has reached even eSports, with widespread news about players throwing matches in high profile games. Detecting if a match is fixed in eSports can be extremely difficult, due to the incredibly dynamic nature of most computer games. In the “first-person shooter” games, there are cases where a player would use a special “cheat” that would give them superior aiming abilities. While cheating is being detected relatively easily, playing “less than your best” can be masked quite well.  </p>

                    <h2 class="vertical-padding">Stay Away from Paid Information About Fixed Matches</h2>
                    <p>The fact that fixed matches are a reality gives birth to a new breed of scammers – those who offer 100% true information about fixed games. Punters that don’t have much experience in the sports betting industry can easily fall prey to this scheme. Stay away from sources that sell “fixed games” information for sports betting! </p>        
                    <h2 class="vertical-padding">In the End, It’s Not Worth It</h2>
                    <p> There are quite a few reasons why fixed match betting isn’t that popular among online punters. First and foremost is the cost – if you’re going to invest a considerable amount of time into researching which match is fixed (and how), you would need to invest a considerable amount of money in order to make a profit. Even with fixed matches, there is a chance that things “won’t go as planned,” and the sustained losses can be devastating. In other cases, if a bookie learns that a market they offer is actually fixed, they can cancel the odds altogether. We recommend to players that they should stay away from “fixed match betting”; after all, it’s better to be safe than sorry. </p>
