                        </div>
                        <p class="f-para padding-top">Simply put, free spins are offered by a casino as an enticement for you to join and try out their games online. You may have to make a deposit as you open an account with the company, but there are also no-deposit free spins from which you can play and turn into real money. Currently, there are several casinos offering EUR10 of their own cash for you to play with so that you need risk none of your own. Here is some more information: </p>

                    <p>Casinos often offer free spins to new customers as a welcome bonus, but existing customers can also find free spin offers as a loyalty bonus or other promotional prize. Before making any commitment, check the casinos’ terms in relation to deposits and conditions on wagers needed before withdrawing cash. Whilst free spins are unlikely to make you a fortune, they can put money into your account to wager on other games with higher rewards.  </p>

                        <p>If no stake is required, the games can be played even if your account is empty. While some online casinos allow free spins on any of their games, others restrict the use of free spins to specified games only, with slots being the most common games. </p>
                        <p>Although online casinos offer free spins to entice in new players, nearly all of them do not allow winnings to be withdrawn immediately. There will usually be a condition that you play with a set number or value of deposits from account first. It will be rare to be given free spins without having to make some financial commitment to the company. </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="f-para padding-top">Slots constitute almost three-quarters of online casino games and have moved on from the days of the one-armed bandit. Their popularity is largely due to the player not needing any complex skills in relation to strategy since slots are based entirely on luck, with the possibility of winning large amounts from limited stakes. Slots offer an immersive experience from sports, fantasy and other entertainment that means there is always something new to try.  Here are some things you need to know about online slots to make the best of your experience:</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center text-white padding-top">Pay lines</h3>
                    <p>Paylines are the series of winning combinations that criss-cross the slots reels. They are the jagged lines that are drawn across the reels of a slot and play a large role in how winning combinations are formed. 
                        Single playlines are found in classic slots with three reels and three rows, with the payline consisting of just three matching symbols. However, there can be many more, depending on the number of reels and rows. For example, a modern 5-reel slot with four rows can have as many as 25, 30 or 50 paylines with a winning payline containing only two matching symbols, or two matching symbols plus Wilds or Scatters.
                        </p>
                        <img src="img/paylines.jpg" alt="find more about the slots pay lines" class="left padding col-lg-4">
                        <p> <a href="online-slots">Most slots let you choose how many paylines you bet on each spin.</a>  Usually, you work with three buttons. You can select any or all paylines manually just by clicking on the numbers running up the side of the reels. You might select 2, 5, or 12 paylines to play with the bet size growing with each selection.
                            Paylines run from Reel 1 on the left, which connects to a symbol on Reel 2, Reel 3, and so on. Payouts are usually made by connecting at least two symbols, but all must connect with Reel 1 in some way. Check out the paytable for each slot, which will provide further information about symbols, jackpots and bonus features, listing every payline pattern in the game, and the game's Return to Player (RTP) percentage.
