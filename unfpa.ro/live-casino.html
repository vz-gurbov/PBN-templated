            <p class="text-strong padding-ud">The closest an online casino can come to providing the real experience native to land-based gambling establishments is through its live dealer games. Just like in a real casino, live dealer games feature a real croupier or a dealer, who manages a genuine game table in a studio set up to look like a land-based casino floor. The footage is streamed in real-time by the website and features a virtual interface overlay, which allows a player to make game decisions or place bets. Although sounding simple enough, there are a few things you should know before embarking on a quest to find the proper live casino online.</p>

            <h2 class="text-size-30 text-line-height-1">Live Dealer Games Are Provided by Software Developers</h2>
            <p class="text-strong padding-ud">When it comes to the standard holders for quality, there are a handful of providers that have solidified their place in the industry. Among them are Evolution Gaming, NetEnt Live, and Ezugi. Evolution Gaming, in particular, is hailed as the best live dealer game provider in the world to this day. It’s unparalleled streaming quality, the number of games and tables, and platform-adaptive interface have been setting the iGaming industry standards since the provider was established more than a decade ago.</p>
            <h2 class="text-size-30 text-line-height-1">Which Are the Best Online Casinos to Play Live Games In?</h2>
            <p class="text-strong padding-ud">888 Casino is a very well-known name in the iGaming world; as such, it comes as no surprise that they offer live dealer games by the industry favorites Evolution Gaming and NetEnt Live. LeoVegas is another online gambling establishment that features the games of the companies mentioned above, and more – Authentic Gaming, Ezugi, and Pragmatic Live. Regardless of the casino website you’ve chosen, the rule of thumb states that if any of the live dealer providers above are present, the chances are that the venue is good. </p>

            <h2 class="text-strong text-size-25">What to Expect from a Live Casino Lobby?</h2>                  
            <p class="text-strong margin-bottom-20">Although the live dealer lobbies of different providers are unique, they will follow the same standard when it comes to their games. Once you access a live dealer lobby, you will see that there will be different game sections – each section will contain a number of live dealer tables. They can differ from one another either by game rules, by bet limits, or by both. </p>
            <h2 class="text-strong text-size-25">This Casino Experience Is Affordable</h2>                  
            <p class="text-strong margin-top-20">It is because of the widely available betting options casino players can easily place a few bets without “breaking the bank.” Some of the smallest live dealer roulette bets can go as low as $0.10, which gives everyone the opportunity to try a spin. Live “Game Shows” also offer low-bet action, and they are quite fun. </p>

            <img src="img/Ezugi.png" alt="the best casinos for live game" class="right padding ezegi">
            <p class="text-strong text-white padding-ud">In some casino websites, visitors can open a live dealer lobby without even having to possess an account (it all depends on the operator’s policy). On the other hand, to access the live lobby of other casinos may require a person to have registered an account, and even have some type of money in it. </p>
            <h2 class="text-size-30 text-line-height-1">Even More Regulated Than Regular Online Casino Games</h2>
            <p class="text-strong text-white padding-ud">The fact the “human factor” is present within a specific game of chance, requires the provider to possess an extra level of safety, security, and assurance of fairness. The live dealer providers we’ve described above are excellent examples of companies that possess all the credentials required by the iGaming industry. Live dealer studios thoroughly evaluate their personnel as well!</p>

                <h2 class="text-size-30 text-line-height-1">What Should People Watch out For</h2>
                <p class="text-strong text-white padding-ud">The industry has seen its fair share of live dealer casino games providers, that neither possess the necessary credentials nor offer fair action. Those can be easily spotted by the terrible video quality of their streaming service, bad audio, and questionable hand movements of their dealers. Although it is a “public secret” that those types of live dealer casinos have questionable ethics, they are prevalent in jurisdictions that forbid gambling in all (or most) forms.</p>
                <h2 class="text-size-30 text-line-height-1">Live Dealer Games Become More Favored by the Players</h2>
                <p class="text-strong text-white padding-ud">A lot of people prefer live dealer games because they do carry the sense of being “unbiased” per se. One thing to remember is that the studios that offer the live game themselves do not deal with money, meaning that it is virtually impossible for the studio to engage in any “shenanigans.” Furthermore, live dealer games in a casino are known to be quite fun – <a class="text-size-20 text-strong" href="/">just make sure you’re playing in a live lobby that looks good!</a></p>
