                                <h1>Casino Sites with the Best RTP Rate</h1>
                                <p>Though the thousands of online casino games may differ by theme and gameplay, they will all have an odds percentage called RTP (return to player). The RTP is a theoretical value that is calculated by the testing agencies and the software developers themselves, in order to determine what will be the alleged return to a player after they have wagered their money. Usually, the RTP percentage of any specific game is determined by the software developer, but there are cases where a casino operator will request that it is either raised or lowered, depending on their business needs. In today’s list, you will learn which casino sites offer the games with the highest return-to-player percentages!</p>
                                <h2>Cash Arcade</h2>
                                <p>When it comes to high RTP, this casino is at the top of almost every reviewing website! The highest RTP rate here is 99%, and it belongs to the slot game “Mega Joker,” made by the company NetEnt. The catch here is that this RTP percentage is part of a special feature triggered within the slot; sadly, the RTP of the normal mode of the game is going to be 85%. This shouldn’t worry players, as Cash Arcade is a casino that offers many other games that feature good odds. </p>
                                <h2>Mr Green Casino</h2>
                                <p>This famous UK online casino offers players the slot game “1429 Uncharted Seas”, which has an RTP of 98.5%. These odds are considered to be quite high by industry standards, and this is why this slot game developed by the company Thunderkick enjoys a lot of attention. Mr. Green is also an establishment that offers quite a few other titles with high RTP percentages. </p>
                                <h2>William Hill Casino</h2>
                                <p>NetEnt is the company that has developed and provided a slot title known as “Blood Suckers.” This William Hill-featured slot has an RTP of 98%, and while its “vampire theme” looks a bit more cartoonish than intended, it is still a great game that offers a lot to its players. William Hill casino is also one of the most renowned online gambling establishments in England and is a good choice for players that want to experience high-RTP games. </p>
                                <h2>Cashmio Casino</h2>
                                <p>This online gambling establishment is home to a slot called “Kings of Chicago,” which has an RTP of 97.8%. Although not as high as the others, the game does have a number of interesting features that elevate its gameplay. Made by the company NetEnt, this slot and others are a part of the Casumo Casino roster, containing hundreds of games made by ten of the most industry-renowned developers.  </p>
                                <h2>BGO Casino</h2>
                                <p>Although BGO takes the last place in this list with an RTP example of 95%, it is still much higher than the majority of online casinos out there. The game in question is called “Thai Flower,” and despite its RTP, it is still a feature-filled slot that’s fun to play. BGO offers deposit match bonuses and gives players the chance to score hundreds of free spins. </p>
                                <h2>There Are Also Games with Multiple RTP Values</h2>
                                <p>Just as the game example in our number one choice, there are many other games that will have different RTP rates, depending on their unique features. It is known that the most common RTP game percentages that players feel comfortable with are those that go above 95%; however, players shouldn’t underestimate the casinos that offer games in the 80% range as well. A lower RTP usually means that the game in question is “High Risk – High Reward.” Although, in the end, it comes down to personal choice, beginner players are advised to try their luck with high RTP games before moving to the “next level of online gambling”. <a href="slots">But before that we should not forget that we have RTP also in the slots gaming!</a> </p>
