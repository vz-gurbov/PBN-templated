							<p>The first mention of Dublin dates back to the 8th and 9th century when Viking raids were a common occurrence. These raids are what led to the establishment of settlements which took place on the southern side of the mouth of Liffey, which went by the name Dubh Linn. This naming was a way to recognize the lake where the Danes first got to moor their boats. It also went by the name black pool.</p>
							<p>Dublin had numerous stone fortifications during these centuries. However, they did not protect it from the sacking that took place over the next two centuries following the establishment of settlements. Residents in the town always found ways in which to rebuild their homes and get on with their activities. As such, the city had made many milestones by the 11th century regarding trade. People in the area fostered good trading links with traders in the nearby towns such as Bristol and Chester. Over time, Dublin got to be one of the most critical cities in Ireland. At that time, it had a population of about four thousand people.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/castle.png" alt="dublin-castle"/></span>
							<h2>The middle ages</h2>
							<p>As from 1169, the Norman rule began, and it went on for the next seven hundred years. Mac Murrough who was the king of Leinster at the time consulted with Strongbow who served as the Earl of Pembroke. Together, these heads plotted ways in which they could conquer Dublin. Mac died a while later. Soon after his death, Strongbow took over the kingdom of Leinster, and he fought against the Vikings as well as the high king of Ireland over the control of Dublin. Strongbow succeeded in the war. The king of England was unsure of whether Strongbow would become too powerful a force to reckon with and thus, he took hold of the opportunity and declared himself the lord of Ireland. Shortly after his declaration, he bestowed Dublin to merchants operating in Bristol.</p>
							<p>In 1190, people living in Dublin underwent a significant loss when the city got devastated by fire. They were able to pick up the pieces once again and in the 13th century, they built a stone fortress in the town. Soon after, developments started taking place in the city such as the appointing of a mayor in 1220. The city began to experience growth both in population as well as in trade. At the end of the 13th century, Dublin had a population of over 8,000 people and was once again a flourishing trade center. All these milestones took place despite an attack on the city by the Scots in 1317</p>
							<p>As from the 14th century all through to the 18th century, Dublin was part of the English <a href="https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/history-and-stories/the-crown-jewels/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crown</a>. During this time, it rose to be the second city of the British Empire. However, it was not all roses in this arrangement as there was a revolt in 1537, owing to the execution of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, an incident which took place in London. Following his death, his heir went on to renounce English sovereignty and set out to attack Dublin. He was successful in gathering an army, but he got defeated and executed before he could accomplish his wishes.</p>

However, the goal posts look like those you would find in a rugby match. When it comes to the gameplay, you can choose to kick, throw or carry the ball and thus there are many ways in which you could win the game.</p>
							<p>Football falls into the category of Gaelic sports and is one of the most popular games in the city. Hurling is also loved, and it is more of playing field hockey in mid-air. Gaelic football and hurling are very popular in the northern side of Dublin, and they fall under the jurisdiction of the Gaelic Athletic Association. For league matches, the Dublin team plays at Parnell Park, and you can catch a game or two when you are in town. When it comes to championship matches, you will find the team in Drumcondra. Many local organizations in the city can introduce you to either of these sports. Get to play football the Irish way! It is an experience that you will not forget.</p>

As such, you will find that most rugby teams have their bases here at Ballsbridge and Donnybrook. One of the most famous clubs in this regard is the Dublin University. Interestingly, this club holds a title as one of the oldest rugby clubs in the world. How cool would it be to see where legends train for the upcoming matches? The only way to find out is by visiting their home-ground. Rugby matches take place at the clubs’ pitches. The Irish Rugby Football Union works to promote the sport by helping people take part in it. As such, if you would like a go at it, you can reach out to one of their teams on the same.</p>
							<h2>Watersports</h2>
							<p>Are you more into sports played on water as opposed to those that take place on land? In Dublin, you can always count on the wind to help you in sailing as well as kite surfing. There are many coasts and slips from where you can enjoy watersports. If you have not taken part in any of these sports before, there are various clubs offering training on the same to both kids and adults.

As such, you can take it easy and enjoy each moment you get to spend in their venues. You will find that the nightlife concentrates around a given area such that you can easily walk from one establishment to another.
