                                <p>The Irish have a deep love of sports, and the situation is no different in Dublin. The most popular games in the city are soccer, rugby and Gaelic football. The latter is a cross between rugby and soccer, and it attracts quite a considerable following. There is also hurling which is quite similar to lacrosse. However, this sport does not have as much audience as the previous three. For individual games, golfing takes the lead followed closely by water sports.</p>
                                <h2>Soccer</h2>

                                <h2>Gaelic football</h2>
                                <p>Not many people have heard of Gaelic sports, and as such, you may get confused as to what the play is. It is a hybrid between rugby and soccer, so you get to combine the best from the two sports, thus ending up with a fascinating game. The ball is round. However, the goal posts look like those you would find in a rugby match. When it comes to the gameplay, you can choose to kick, throw or carry the ball and thus there are many ways in which you could win the game.</p>
                                <p>Football falls into the category of Gaelic sports and is one of the most popular games in the city. Hurling is also loved, and it is more of playing field hockey in mid-air. Gaelic football and hurling are very popular in the northern side of Dublin, and they fall under the jurisdiction of the Gaelic Athletic Association. For league matches, the Dublin team plays at Parnell Park, and you can catch a game or two when you are in town. When it comes to championship matches, you will find the team in Drumcondra. Many local organizations in the city can introduce you to either of these sports. Get to play football the Irish way! It is an experience that you will not forget.</p>
