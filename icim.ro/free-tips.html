They call it luck; others call it a skill while others call it experience. Either way, you can get carried away with how blissful things sound and end up placing a bet. Now, here is the thing that people do not tell you- betting is hard. Not only do you rely on luck, but you also need to be knowledgeable as to placing wagers.

Not only will they give you a feel of what it is like to bet, but they will help you learn a lot about it. Here goes:</p>

                            <p>Here, you get into the deep end of the swimming pool. The catch, however, is that you have a floater with you all the while. What does all this mean? Well, this app gives you a feel of what it would be like to bet on a real-time event. Suppose there is a soccer match taking place, and you feel that a particular team is stronger. What should you do? Should you take your hard-earned money and wager it on a hunch that could be wrong? No, you place a wager on this app without any cash and see how it plays out. In this way, you can tell if your analytical skills can come in handy in the real world. After several tries, you can let go of the floater and use some real cash in your bets. Remember not to rush the process and to take it one day at a time.</p>
